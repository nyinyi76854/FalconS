            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last Updated: 1/28/2025</p>

            <p>Thank you for using our application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app, specifically regarding the storage of messages and other data.</p>

            <h2>1. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
            <p>We use Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage services provided by Google to store your messages and other related data securely.</p>

            <h3>Messages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Messages sent through the app are stored in Firebase Firestore as structured data for efficient retrieval and synchronization across devices.</li>
                <li>Attachments, such as images and videos, are stored in Firebase Storage. These files are linked to corresponding entries in Firestore for proper management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take data security seriously and implement the following measures to protect your information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All data stored in Firebase Firestore and Storage is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols.</li>
                <li>Access to the database is restricted to authenticated users, and Firebase Authentication is used to ensure only authorized users can access their data.</li>
                <li>We periodically review and update our security practices to align with current standards and best practices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
            <p>The messages and attachments you send are used solely for the purpose of providing the core functionality of the app, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Delivering messages to recipients in real-time.</li>
                <li>Storing and displaying message history for your convenience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not share or sell your data to third parties for marketing or other purposes.</p>

            <h2>4. User Control</h2>
            <p>You have full control over your data. You can delete messages and attachments at any time through the app. Once deleted, the data will be permanently removed from Firebase Firestore and Storage.</p>

            <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>As we rely on Firebase, your data is subject to Firebaseâ€™s <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We encourage you to review their policy to understand how your data is handled by Google.</p>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
