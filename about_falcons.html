        <h1>About Falcons</h1>
        <p>Falcons is an ecosystem consisting of both an Android App and a Desktop App, designed to work seamlessly with a shared database. This ensures that users can access their data from either platform without any loss of continuity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Account Creation:</strong> While Falcons provides cross-platform access, user account creation is exclusive to the Android App. This means that new users must register through the Android application before they can log in and use the Desktop App.</p>
        
        <p>Once an account is created via the Android App, users can log in with their credentials on both the Android and Desktop versions. This setup ensures security, streamlined registration, and consistency across platforms.</p>
